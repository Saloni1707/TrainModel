# TrainModel

Linear Regression with Keras – 
We trained a linear regression model using Keras to predict taxi fares based on trip data.

Features Used
TRIP_MILES (distance)

TRIP_MINUTES (duration, derived from TRIP_SECONDS)

What We Did
Built and trained a linear model:
FARE = w1 * TRIP_MILES + w2 * TRIP_MINUTES + bias

Tuned hyperparameters: learning rate, epochs, batch size

Visualized:

Loss curve (RMSE vs Epochs)

Prediction surface

Worked on model weights, bias, and equation

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras, Plotly

Environment: Google Colab

Key Takeaways
Understood how linear models learn

Explored batch training and RMSE loss

Practiced visualizing model predictions
